* 3/4 cups (1 small) onions finely chopped
* 1/2 cup (2 small) tomatoes deseeded & chopped or pureed
* 1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste

* 3/4 cup water to cook
* 3 tablespoons cream


1/8 teaspoon cumin seeds
2  green cardamoms
1 inch cinnamon
2  cloves

## Instructions

1. Pluck only the young & tender spinach leaves and discard the stems as they may leave a bitter taste.  If using baby spinach you can use the stems as well.
2. Make sure the spinach is dry before cooking.
3. Heat half tablespoon oil in a pan. Saute green chilies, cashews and spinach for 3 to 4 mins until the leaves wilt off thoroughly.
4. Immerse in ice cold water. Drain completely
5. Cool this completely. 
6. Blend this along with water to a smooth puree. The puree should be smooth and thick. You may add 1 to 2 tbsps more water to help in blending.
7. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and half tablespoon oil to the same pan, Once they melt, add cinnamon, cardamoms, cloves & cumin seeds.
8. When the spices begin to sizzle, add onions and fry till they turn transparent to golden.
9. Next saute ginger garlic paste for 1 to 2 minutes or until you begin to smell it nice.
10. Then add tomatoes with salt. Saute until they break down and turn mushy.
11. Add garam masala & saute until the masala smells good. This may take 2 mins.
12. Pour water and cook covered until onions are completely soft. There should be some water left in the pan.
13. Lower the flame, add kasuri methi and pureed spinach. Mix well and cook until it begins to bubble for about 2 to 3 mins.  If the curry is too thick you may add a few tbsps of hot water.
14. Avoid overcooking. Add paneer & mix well. 
15. Turn off and remove to a serving bowl. 
16. Optionally garnish with cream

## Notes

* You can substitute ginger garlic paste with 1 teaspoon each minced ginger and garlic.
* For a smoother gravy, after sauteing the onion and tomatoes with garam masala cool it & blend to a smooth puree with 1/2 to 3/4 cup water. Cook this until you see traces of oil. When the gravy thickens add the palak puree.
* If using baby spinach, stems can be used. If using mature spinach, avoid using stalks & stems as they may lend a bitter taste. Cut off each stem from the leaves. Overcooking palak can leave a bitter taste.
* You can use more spinach if you like.
* Whole spices are optional. But they do add a lot of flavor to the dish. However you can skip them and add more garam masala to suit your taste.
* Optional: If using store bought paneer, then cube them and add to 2 cups hot water. Keep these immersed for 10 mins. Drain and use.
