## Instructions ###

### The Bread ###

1. Pre-heat the over to 325 F.
2. Cut the bread into dozens of thin slices.  Cut the bread diagonally in order to make the pieces slightly longer than they are tall.  Each piece should be 1/8th to 1/4th of an inch thick.
3. Lightly butter each slice of bread.
4. Sprinkle each piece of bread liberally with garlic salt and black pepper.
5. Bake the bread in the over for 20 minute to half an hour until the bread is crisp but still gives just a little bit when you press in the center of a slice with a finger.

### The Topping ###

1. Roughly chop the fresh garden tomatoes - remove the seeds during the process.
2. Pull apart the fresh mozzarella by hand into roughly the same size as the tomato chunks.
3. Chop the fresh basil leaves - not too finely.
4. Mix all ingredients together in a bowl.  Sprinkle with balsamic vinegar to taste.

### Altogether Now ###

Take a toasted piece of bread, slather with hummus, and spoon on as much of the tomato topping as you can balance.  Eat.  This will provide a meal for 2 people or an appetizer for 6 to 8.
