# Chicken Korma  

## Ingredients

1 lb chicken (boneless breast pieces)
1 cup of yoghurt
enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan
1 tsp (heaped) garlic paste
1 tsp (heaped) ginger paste
1 tsp red chili powder
0-1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp “garam masala”
1 large onion (sliced) 
 
## Instructions 

### Prep Work 

1. Defrost and wash chicken.  Cut chicken into 1 inch strips, and prick with a fork. 
2. Add garlic paste, ginger paste, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt to the yoghurt and mix together. 
3. Marinate chicken in yoghurt in a covered container in fridge for at least 1 hour. 
 

### Cook 

4. Heat oil in saucepan and brown the sliced onion in oil on medium-high.   
5. Add all the chicken pieces to the saucepan (without marinate).   
6. Stir and turn chicken pieces over after a few minutes.   
7. When chicken pieces have browned, add marinate.   
8. Let cook covered on low heat for one hour. 

### Notes:
* The red chili powder you can buy in an Indian grocery store is very different and much hotter
than what you can buy in a normal grocery store.  I mix them half-and-half usually.  Also, this
amount of sauce is a bit skimpy for a lb of chicken, so I increase it by 1/4 - 1/2.
