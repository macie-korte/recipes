Play with the ratios of rice flour to regular flour.  I don't remember what I used in the past.

## Instructions

### Rice Flour Batter

1. Place the flour/starch, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir to mix everything. Only prepare your batter when you are ready to fry your food.
2. Pour in the ice cold water into the flour mixture and use a chopstick to stir. Do not over stir with all-purpose flour. It's okay to have some lumps in the batter. If you over mix the flour batter, it will turn out gummy and absorbs too much oil. If you are preparing gluten-free batter, this is not an issue because cornstarch doesn't have gluten in it

### Korean Chile Sauce

1. Place all sauce ingredients into a blender and process until incorporated and smooth, scraping the sides occasionally to ensure even blending.
2. Transfer into a storage container until needed

Shelf Life: 3 days

### Fry the Cauliflower

1. Place the cauliflower pieces, rice flour, baking powder, salt and pepper (pinch) into a small mixing bowl and toss to incorporate. Do not discard any excess flour.
2. Ladle the rice flour batter into the bowl and fold to incorporate.
3. Fry the cauliflower pieces at 350 degrees until golden brown and crispy (approx. 4 mins.). Drain over the fryer and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels.
4. Heat the Korean chile sauce in a non-stick sauté pan set over medium heat and bring to a simmer.
5. Add the cauliflower into the pan, tossing to incorporate.
6. Mound the cauliflower into a bowl.
7. Sprinkle the green onion, lime zest and sesame seeds evenly over the cauliflower.
8. Sprinkle the lime zest evenly over the cauliflower.
9. Ladle the ranch dressing into a small dish and serve on the side with the lime wedge.
