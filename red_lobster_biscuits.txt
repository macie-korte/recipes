Ingredients:

2 ½ cups Bisquick baking mix

¾ cup cold whole milk

8 tablespoons cold butter (1 whole stick)

1/3 teaspoon garlic powder

1+1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese (extra sharp!)



Bush on Top:

4 tablespoons butter, melted

1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes

1 teaspoon garlic powder (maybe a little less)



Directions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.

2. Combine Bisquick with cold butter in a medium bowl using a pastry cutter or a large fork. You don't want to mix too thoroughly. There should be small chunks of butter in there that are about the size of peas. Add cheddar cheese, milk, and ¼ teaspoon garlic. Mix by hand until combined, but don't over mix.

3. Drop approximately ¼-cup portions of the dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet using an ice cream scoop.

4. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until the tops of the biscuits begin to turn light brown.  Turn up heat to 400 about half to 2/3 the way through baking time.

5. When you take the biscuits out of the oven, melt 2 tablespoons butter is a small bowl in your microwave. Stir in teaspoon garlic powder and the dried parsley flakes. Use a brush to spread this garlic butter over the tops of all the biscuits. Use up all of the butter. 

6.  Liberally sprinkle lemon herb seasoning on top.


Extra Info:

Makes one dozen biscuits.
McCormick lemon herb seasoning has been tried & works well on top
Sharp cheddar: Crystal Farms "Extra Sharp" preshedder cheddar is not sharp enough.
"" Extra Sharp not pre-shredder works well.
