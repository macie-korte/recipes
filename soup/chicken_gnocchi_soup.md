* 1 heaping TBSP diced garlic
* 3.5 cups of chicken broth (preferably homemade)
* 1 cup carrots, very thinly sliced
* 1 cup torn rotisserie chicken (white and dark meat)
* 1.5 cups of cooked gnocchi (homemade is best)
* 1.5 cups of fresh spinach de-stemmed coarsely torn (each leave torn in half or quarters)

## Instructions ##

1. Create and boil your homemade gnocchi until you have a cup and a half of gnocchi cooked and reserved.
2. Saute the onion, celery, and garlic in olive oil for a few minutes over medium heat until the onion becomes translucent.  Remove the mixture from the pan and reserve
3. Melt the butter in the now empty pan.  Slowly add in the flour while whisking to make a roux.  Let the butter and flour mixture cook for about a couple minutes.
4. Add in the pint of heavy cream while continuing to whisk
5. Add the carrot & celery mixture back into the mix.
5. Into the roux, add in the carrots and chicken.
6. Once the mixture becomes thick, add in the chicken broth.
7. Once the mixture thickens again, add the cooked gnocchi, spinach, and seasoning.  If the mixture refuses to thicken, mix flour into water and use this to thicken the soup until it is thick enough.  The soup should NOT be watery.
8. Simmer until soup is heated through.  Before serving season to taste by adding additional salt.
