2 quarts of "no chicken" broth
2 tsp salt
3 tsp cumin
1 tsp chili pepper
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 15oz can cooked azuki beans
1 15oz can chickpeas / garbonzo beans
1 28oz can whole tomatoes in tomato sauce
2 small to medium white onions
2-3 TBSP garlic
small package corn tortillas or bag or tortilla strips
1 whole garden salsa pepper (minus seed) or equivalent amount of jalapeno
black pepper to taste
1/4 tsp - 1/2 tsp of oregano and thyme
a bit of lime juice
cilantro
frozen corn
a few spoons of cotija cheese or cottage cheese as a substitute
miso paste (preferrably red)
3 TBSP olive oil
2 cups peanut oil


___Make Tortilla Strips___
Either buy premade tortilla strips or do this step
1) Cut a few tortillas into long 1/4 inch thick strips
2) deep fry the strips in the peanut oil
3) take out when crispy.  Place on paper towels and salt.


___Make Soup___
1) stir-fry chopped white onions and garlic in the olive oil.
2) stir in the cumin, chili pepper, and paprika
3) Pour in the "no chicken" broth and bring to a boil
4) Add diced jalapeno or garden pepper - boil for a few minutes
5) Add in chickpeas - boil for a few minutes
6) Add in roughly chopped tomatoes, and some oregano and thyme - boil for 5-10 minutes.  
7) Landle out roughly 2 cups of the soup into a blender.  Add half of the Azuki beans and blend to a puree.
   Mix this puree back into the soup.
8) Add in the 2nd half of the Azuki beans.
9) Stir in around 3 TBSP of Miso paste through a metal strainer - add to taste as Miso paste is salty.
10) Pour in as much of the tomato juice from the can as desired... probably not all of it.
11) Salt to taste if more salt is needed.
12) Add the frozen corn - boil for a few minutes
13) Throw in a TBSP of loosely packed torn cilantro
14) Squirt in some lime juice


___Garnish Soup___
1) Remove from heat and put in serving bowls.
2) Crumble cotija cheese -OR- rinse off the cottage cheese with cool water until all white liquid (whey?) is gone
3) spoon a good amount of the cheese curds into the soup.
4) Garnish soup with more cilantro leaves.
5) Do not put tortilla strips into soup before serving.  Server them on the side so that people can add them as they want.  They get soggy fast.

Other ideas:
* Put some fresh avocado on top for extra substance.
* When eating it I thought it would be good with brown rice added like the chicken tomato soup recipe.
