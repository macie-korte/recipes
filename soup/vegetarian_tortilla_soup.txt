2 quarts of "no chicken" broth
2 tsp salt
3 tsp cumin
1 tsp chili pepper
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 15oz can cooked azuki beans
1 15oz can chickpeas / garbonzo beans
1 28oz can whole tomatoes in tomato sauce
2 small to medium white onions
2-3 TBSP garlic
small package corn tortillas or bag or tortilla strips
1 whole garden salsa pepper (minus seed) or equivalent amount of jalapeno
black pepper to taste
pinch of oregano and thyme
a bit of lime juice
cilantro
frozen corn
a few spoons full of cottage cheese
3 TBSP olive oil
2 cups peanut oil


___Make Tortilla Strips___
Either buy premade tortilla strips or do this step
1) Cut a few tortillas into long 1/4 inch thick strips
2) deep fry the strips in the peanut oil
3) take out when crispy.  Place on paper towels and salt.


___Make Soup___
1) stir-fry chopped white onions and garlic in the olive oil.
2) stir in the cumin, chili pepper, and paprika
3) Pour in the "no chicken" broth and bring to a boil
4) Add diced jalapeno or garden pepper - boil for a few minutes
5) Add in chickpeas - boil for a few minutes
6) Add in roughly chopped tomatoes, half of the Azuki beans, and some oregano and thyme - boil for 5-10 minutes.  The Azuki beans added now will partially dissolve and add to the thickness of the broth.
7) Salt to taste and then pour in as much of the tomato juice from the can as desired... probably not all of it.
8) Add the rest of the Azuki beans and the frozen corn - boil for a while
9) Throw in a TBSP of loosely packed torn cilantro
10) Squirt in some lime juice


___Garnish Soup___
1) Remove from heat and put in serving bowls.
2) Rinse off the cottage cheese with cool water until all white liquid (whey?) is gone
3) spoon a good amount of the cottage cheese curds into the soup.
4) Garnish soup with more cilantro leaves.
5) Do not put tortilla strips into soup before serving.  Server them on the side so that people can add them as they want.  They get soggy fast.

Other ideas:
* Put some fresh avocado on top for extra substance.
* Try adding a bit of miso paste instead of salt.
* When eating it I thought it would be good with brown rice added like the chicken tomato soup recipe.
