MINNESOTA WILD RICE SOUP

1/2 cup wild rice, uncooked
1 quart water
1/2 cup ham, minced to 1/8-inch
1/2 cup onion, minced to 1/8-inch
1/2 cup carrots, shredded
1 quart plus 1 cup chicken stock
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 1/4 teaspoons white pepper
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon butter
1 1/8 cups flour
1/2 cup almonds, slivered and toasted
1 pint half-and-half

Place uncooked wild rice in water and boil for 45 minutes or until tender and rice has broken and flowered. When rice is done, rinse lightly under cold water and drain. Set aside.

Saute ham, onion and carrots over medium-high heat in a stockpot until tender.

Add chicken stock, salt and white pepper and continue to heat.

In a separate saute pan, melt butter and add flour to make a roux. Cook roux over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 10 minutes.

Add cooked roux to chicken stock and stir until you have a uniform consistency. Stir in cooked rice and almonds. Stir in half-and-half and hold over medium heat for 20 minutes.
